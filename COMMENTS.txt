I found this project very interessting and I really liked doing it. I won't change anything.
As I did it in Java it was very easy.
The only suggestion that I can make is that starting on assignement 2 we have those informations : 
OpenSSL(www.openssl.org)
JavaJCA(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/ crypto/CryptoSpec.html)
Python (https://pypi.org/project/cryptography)

Indeed, I really struggled on assignement 2 because I did it in C.
